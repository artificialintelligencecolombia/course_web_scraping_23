==============================
FETCH CHANGES FROM REMOTE REPO
==============================

---------------------
CHECK UPDATES ON REMOTE && LOCAL
---------------------

The objective is to check which repository is up-to-date (if local or remote).

1) git fetch origin
To obtain the lastest updates from the remote repository.

2) git log origin/main -1
Displays the last commit on the remote for the main branch. -> replace 'main' for needed branch.

3) git log main -1
Shows the last commit on the local main branch.


NOTE: CHECK FOR THE LASTEST TIMESTAMP OR THE HIGHEST ORDER IN THE LOG -> This is the most recent one.
IF THEY DIFFER THEN CHECK THE ABOVE.

4) git pull origin main
Fetches the lastest changes from the remote and merge them into my local branch.

5) git commit
final merge

6) git log -1
lastest commit has should match the lastest commit on the remote branch.
